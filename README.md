# Pomodoro-Clock

This is a JavaScript project for [Free Code Camp challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-pomodoro-clock)

You can [view the site here](http://codepen.io/AsimoLoveGym/full/vXjYVb/)

## How to Use:

Use slider to adjust the Pomodoro time you'd like to work with. 

Default setting is:

Work: 25 mins 
Break: 5 mins

After click **"play"** button, it will continue counting until a full cycle finished (one work and one break). You can also **"pause"** the counting or **"restart"** from beginning.
